Howdy pardners, this is what needs doing for the VM:

- Rewrite parsing functions to be able to read flags
	(e.g. -d 420 stores the dump_cycle, so that the arena prints at cycle 420).
	Currently, only -n is read and it's hardcoded, so the system could use a little
	regorganisation.

	Currently working on this:

- Writing statement commands. Currently Teemu is handling those, so if you're up for
	helping, hit ya boi up. The current framework is ready to have them implemented.

	Currently working on this: Teemu,

- Documentation. If you're writing functions, try to document them so it's easier for
	us to read your code. Not super necessary, but will streamline the teamwork.
	Place comments on the line directly above the function so that each function has
	it's description updated in VS_Code!

	Currently working on this:

- Updating cycles_to_die after each cycle. Currently it's just decreased, but I believe
	there's cases where it's decreased differently (minus CYCLES_DELTA)

	Currently working on this: Sam

- Refining the project to align with the game rules. I need to remind myself of what the
	fucking rules are, but there should be some checks and shit.

	Currently working on this:
