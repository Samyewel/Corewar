_Short Summary_

As with all Hive projects, they come with restraints and limitations. We have to abide by the rules of `Norminette`. Here are some of the rules we must follow:

```
* The mandatory part must be written in C
* 25 lines maximum per function
* 5 functions maximum per file
* 80 columns wide maximum
* 5 variables per function maximum
* For loops are forbidden
* Declaration and an initialisation cannot be on the same line
* A function can take 4 named parameters maximum
* Printf is forbidden - But we can use our own version made in a previous project (ft_printf)
* Functions allowed:
  * write
  * malloc
  * realloc
  * free
  * open
  * close
  * read
  * sterror
  * perror
  * lseek
  * exit
```
